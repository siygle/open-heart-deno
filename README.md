# Open Heart Protocol by Deno

Just saw a really cool project which implement a social "Like" easily by the simple protocol called [**Open Heart**](https://openheart.fyi/), so I made a Deno version quickly. üòÅ

## How

Just folk this project (hope one day Deno Deploy will also support deploy button as well ü§û), and update the `project name` inside the `[.github/workflows/deploy.yml](/.github/workflows/deploy.yml)` to your own project name on Deno Deploy.

After deployment, you can use the domain as your Open Heart service. Others, just follow the offical document on the [project site](https://github.com/dddddddddzzzz/OpenHeart).
